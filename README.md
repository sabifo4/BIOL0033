# BIOL0033 practical sessions

Welcome to the BIOL0033 module! During the next sessions, you will be navigating and familiarising yourselves with the **phylogenetics workflow**! We will particularly focus on the following steps:

* Downloading sequences in FASTA format using the web browser and the terminal
* Downloading protein structures from the PDB and visualising them
* Generating multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using nucleotide, protein, and structural data
* Reconstructing phylogenies under various approaches
* Testing for positive selection

To check what we will be doing each day, please follow the links below:

* [Day 1](day1/README.md)
* [Day 2](day2/README.md)
* [Day 3](day3/README.md)

Before getting started, please make sure that you can access the [RStudio Server](https://biol0033.arc.ucl.ac.uk/) we will be using during the practical sessions -- massive thanks to [Stephen Lang](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/104417-stephen-lang) and [Werner Van Niekerk](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/60984-werner-van-niekerk) from [UCL's Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-c) for providing us with these wonderful resources! Please follow [this link](server/README.md) to learn how to connect to the server.

Hope you enjoy this journey!
